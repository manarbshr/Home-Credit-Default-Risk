## Description

The Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of default on a loan application based on various features provided by Home Credit, a non-banking financial institution. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical loan data and develop predictive models to assist in credit risk assessment.

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment of predictive models



## Usage

After installation, you can use the project for:

- Exploring the dataset: Use Jupyter Notebook to open and analyze the provided datasets (`application_train.csv`, `application_test.csv`, etc.).
- Training models: Run the model training scripts (`train_model.py`) to train machine learning models on the dataset.
- Evaluating models: Use evaluation scripts (`evaluate_model.py`) to assess the performance of trained models.
- Deploying models: Deploy trained models to a production environment for real-time prediction.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you encounter any issues, have suggestions for improvement, or want to add new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.
